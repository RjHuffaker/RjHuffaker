Hello :)

I am Ryan Huffaker, and I do a lot of different things. I have a BA in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing, but since graduating I have also taught myself how to build responsive web applications using the latest JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular. I also have extensive experience writing Javascript userscripts to streamline repetitive work processes and provide flexible functionality to existing web pages.
