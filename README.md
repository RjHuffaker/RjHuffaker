Hello :)

I am Ryan Huffaker, and I do a lot of different things. I have a BA in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing, but since graduating in 2011 I have also taught myself how to build responsive web applications using the latest Javascript frameworks such as React and Angular. I also have extensive experience writing Javascript userscripts to streamline repetitive work processes and provide flexible functionality to existing web pages.

When not altering the very fabric of internet reality, I find myself drawn to a life of adventure and exploration, traveling the country full-time with my spouse and four children. Our latest adventure has been to convert a retired school bus into a pirate-ship on wheels, but with beds and appliances instead of cannons, and solar panels instead of sails. In other words, a skoolie.

Building a skoolie will provide us with an unprecedented level of freedom and flexibility, but with the golden age of piracy long since expired, I am currently in the market for work as a programmer/developer. I also have experience in customer service and data entry, and being on the road full-time has taught me the importance of cultivating a variety of skills. In a pinch I can fix almost anything, learn any system, and adapt to whatever is thrown my way.
